# Hello

This repo contains some basic RazorEngine functionality to retrieve Razor views from the *files/content* directory, merge it with the json data in the *files/data* directory, and output the resulting html into the *files/output* directory.

It's just a console app and there are a few basic tests around the main class **RenderHtmlPage**.

>Initially the cshtml and json files are not committed; these will be included in later commits.
